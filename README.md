## Projetct Introduction
A implementation of project to use Raspberry Pi to design an intelligent wheelchair. It can not only provide users with the current weather and temperature, and could also detect the ground humidity and obstacles and give users feedback. It ensures the safety of wheelchair users.


## Equipment
Raspberry Pi 4B
QT 5.13
C++ language

## How it works
*****
| Function | GPIO | BOARD | wiringPi |
| ---------------- | ----- | -----| -----|
| Go forward | 21 | 29 | 21 |
| Go backward | 22 | 31 | 22 |
| Obstacle detecting | 23 | 33 | 23 |
| Obstacle detecting | 24 | 35 | 24 |
| Ground detecting | 25 | 37 | 25 |
| Dht11 | 26 | 32 | 26|
#### Obstacles detecting:
We use GPIO.23 and GPIO.24 interfaces as two obstacle detecting sensors' input. When the wheelchair is blocked behind, these two sensors give input to the Pi and we read the reference to control the wheelchair to stop. If obstacles are detected, that information will be shown on the GUI. 
#### Wet ground detecting:
    The GPIO.26 is used to detect if the ground is wet or not. 
    When the sensor gets the wet signal, it sends that to the Pi and we command the wheelchair to stop through that signal. 
    If ground is detected as wet, that information will be shown on the GUI. 
    
    We have a dht11 sensor to show the temperature and humidity of the surroundings. 
    The data is shown on the GUI as integers. It reminds the user to wear suitable clothes outside. The GPIO.25 is user for dht11 sensor.

    Of course, to simulate the wheelchair, there're two buttons that are connected to GPIO.21 and GPIO.22.
    When we push the button, the wheelchair can be controlled to move forward and backward as if they were handled by user in the real world.
    
    Finally, the wheels are controlled using GPIO.1~6. There are 5 functions to control the wheelchair to step forward, backward, turn left, right and stop.
